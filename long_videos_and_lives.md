This page showcases a curated selection of my most relevant long-format videos and livestreams. These sessions are designed to go deeper into technical topics, combining code walkthroughs, tool demos, and audience Q&A. All videos are produced, recorded, and edited by me, including live stream logistics across multiple platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Twitch).


## Playlist "Web apps Python en minutos con Streamlit"

A short [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3S_Kja8U3N7obVORJ8AE5ToR1OOsqtsv&si=Fq2We9QsWJ9yXaXY) demonstrating the power of Streamlit, a Python library for building dashboards and web apps with minimal effort. To show how fast and intuitive the development process can be, I use real-world examples like, a duplicate of the TikTok stats dasboard and an improvement to an open data dashboard from Mexico City subway.

üìä The top video in this series has surpassed 21K views.

## Playlist "LeetCode 75 con Python"

A [livestream series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3S_Kja8U3N7mOkUCWojPJrDtr4LR-b3Z&si=PV4vPKYc9frinC79) where I solve problems from the LeetCode 75 challenge in Python. I explain my reasoning in real-time and engage with questions from the audience. The format is casual but technical‚Äîfocused on making algorithmic problem solving more transparent and less intimidating.

üé• Broadcasted simultaneously to YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch.

## Playlist "Libro y Curso 'Python Para Todos' en Espa√±ol"

A [series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3S_Kja8U3N5ZPR6BTqAy39zmwLvLY6q2&si=gEfqq5X3MT74eXlj) that follows the ‚ÄúPython for Everybody‚Äù open course from the University of Michigan. I walk through each module in Spanish, updating examples to reflect modern Python versions and adding explanations and providing additional examples to clarify key topics where needed.

üìò This series makes foundational Python content more accessible for Spanish-speaking audiences.
