This page features selected technical blog posts I‚Äôve written, showcasing my ability to explain concepts clearly, guide readers through practical implementations, and reflect on real-world developer experiences.


## Facebook Messenger Bot using Facebook API data (Winner of a DevPost Challenge)

(This post](https://mkfnx.github.io/Facebook-API-en-bot-de-Messenger/) presents a project that connects a Django-based backend with the Facebook Graph API to retrieve group content, process interaction data, and expose it in JSON format to be consumed by a Messenger chatbot.

The tutorial walks through API authentication, pagination handling, data filtering, and rendering the result either in HTML or structured Messenger templates. The backend integrates with Chatfuel to enable a user-friendly flow.

üèÜ This post won a regional award in a DevPost content creation challenge and has been cited as a resource by community members.


## Barbell plates calculator

This project is part of a larger frontend certification track inspired by freeCodeCamp challenges. [This tutorial](https://mkfnx.github.io/fCC-Barbell-1/) demonstrates how to build a weight plate calculator for gym barbells using JavaScript.
The problem is broken down into clear steps: parsing input, applying validation rules, computing symmetric loading with minimal plate count, and optimizing code readability through modular functions.
Readers are guided through real implementation using CodePen, with considerations for UX, edge cases, and code maintainability. A functional version and a refactored version are both shared as live examples.


## Internship Program Content Hub

[This post](https://mkfnx.github.io/encora-apprentice/) compiles key resources and original content I created to promote the Encora Apprentice program. It includes a LinkedIn write-up, short-form TikTok video, and two interviews: one with program graduates and one with the program‚Äôs coordinator (link not available anymore).

The goal was to share actionable information for aspiring developers and expand the visibility of early-career opportunities in tech. This post exemplifies my ability to engage with real professionals, synthesize useful insights, and amplify them across platforms.

Focus areas: Developer advocacy, tech outreach, early-career guidance, multi-platform content curation
