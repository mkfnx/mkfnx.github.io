This page features selected technical blog posts I‚Äôve written, showcasing my ability to explain concepts clearly, guide readers through practical implementations, and reflect on real-world developer experiences.


## Facebook Messenger Bot using Facebook API data (Winner of a DevPost Challenge)

[This post](https://mkfnx.github.io/Facebook-API-en-bot-de-Messenger/) presents a project that connects a Django-based backend with the Facebook Graph API to retrieve group content, process interaction data, and expose it in JSON format to be consumed by a Messenger chatbot.

The tutorial walks through API authentication, pagination handling, data filtering, and rendering the result either in HTML or structured Messenger templates. The backend integrates with Chatfuel to enable a user-friendly flow.

üèÜ This post won a regional award in a DevPost content creation challenge and has been cited as a resource by community members.


## Barbell plates calculator

This project is part of a larger frontend certification track inspired by freeCodeCamp challenges. [This tutorial](https://mkfnx.github.io/fCC-Barbell-1/) demonstrates how to build a weight plate calculator for gym barbells using JavaScript.
The problem is broken down into clear steps: parsing input, applying validation rules, computing symmetric loading with minimal plate count, and optimizing code readability through modular functions.
Readers are guided through real implementation using CodePen, with considerations for UX, edge cases, and code maintainability. A functional version and a refactored version are both shared as live examples.


## Learning React Native

I authored a two-part introductory series on building mobile apps with React Native and Expo, published on Medium in Spanish. The articles walk readers through [the initial setup](https://medium.com/@mkfnx/crear-apps-multiplataforma-con-react-native-y-exponent-30ef81f96088), [UI components, JSX syntax, and app structure](https://medium.com/@mkfnx/primera-app-con-react-native-y-exponent-9054eb0f4f20), using simple examples to explain core concepts of React development.

While the content is from 2017, it reflects my early commitment to sharing technical knowledge clearly and accessibly for Spanish-speaking audiences. The posts remain relevant for beginners exploring mobile development and show my ability to break down frameworks into digestible, actionable steps.


## Data Visualization of Mexico's Presidential Press Conferences

I created [a post](https://mkfnx.github.io/palabras-mas-mencionadas-en-las-mananeras/) for showcasing a [web tool](https://palabrera.mkfnx.dev/) I build to explore word frequency trends in Mexico‚Äôs presidential conferences ("ma√±aneras") from 2018 to 2024. The site displays daily word clouds and allows users to search for terms that appeared among the top 10 on any given day.

The project involved scraping official transcripts, preprocessing text (NLTK stopwords + custom adjustments), and generating visualizations using Python libraries like WordCloud and Matplotlib. I designed a minimal frontend hosted on Firebase, with simple date selection and keyword search implemented in vanilla JS.

It serves both as a technical exercise in data engineering and as a civic visualization resource.
