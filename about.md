I'm a Software Engineer based in Mexico City. As of 2025, I'm working as a devops Support Engineer, but I also keep and eye on other popular technologies such as Python, Data Science and cool FE Frameworks.

I've been creating tech ed content in spanish for [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@mkfnx) (30k+) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@mkfnx11) and even experimented with some livestreams solving leetcode problems.
